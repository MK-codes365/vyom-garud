# **App Name**: SkyCommand

## Core Features:

- MAVLink Communication: Establish and maintain real-time MAVLink communication with the drone simulator for command and telemetry.
- Telemetry Visualization: Display real-time telemetry data (altitude, speed, GPS coordinates, battery level, etc.) from the drone simulator in an intuitive format.
- Flight Path Planning: Define and upload flight paths to the drone simulator. This could involve drawing paths on a map or inputting GPS coordinates.
- Manual Control Override: Provide manual control options (joystick or keyboard input) to override the automated flight path if necessary.
- Geofencing: Define virtual boundaries (geofences) and trigger alerts if the drone simulator deviates from the permitted area.
- Automated Task Execution: Use generative AI tool to analyze real-time data from the drone and incorporate weather forecast data, suggesting adjustments to the flight plan.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke a sense of reliability and technological sophistication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface.
- Use clean, line-based icons to represent drone functions and data points.
- Prioritize a clear and uncluttered layout, with real-time data prominently displayed.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback and guide the user's attention.
